    <h3>What do you think about people's reaction to the events in the story? </h3>
    <p>Events and circumstances in our life donâ€™t come pre-packaged with any labels such as good or bad. Instead, we are
        the ones who attach a negative or positive meaning by the perspective with which we view them.</p>
