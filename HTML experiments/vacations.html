            <p>Chennai is my favourite travel destination.With temples, beaches and centres of historical and cultural
            significance
            including the UNESCO Heritage Site of Mahabalipuram, Chennai is one of the most-visited cities in India.
            Chennai has a 19+ km coastline with many beaches including the Marina spanning 13 km (8.1 mi) which is the
            second-longest urban beach
            in the world.

        <div style="border:solid black 2px"><p>Goa is my second favourite travel destination.Over 450 years of Portuguese rule and the influence of the
            Portuguese culture presents to visitors to
            Goa a cultural environment that is not found elsewhere in India.Goa has one World Heritage Site: the Bom Jesus
            Basilica[75] with churches and convents of Old Goa.
            Most of the beauty of Goa is present on the beaches. The coastline of about 103 km has some of the most
            attractive beaches flanked by the Arabian Sea.
